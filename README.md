# Career Path Test

This is a prototype of the new "Career Path Test". 

This is a short list of questions which our members can complete and will be given suggested career paths in response.

Created using vite timplate for React, TypeScript.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Using Node Version Manager (nvm)

```bash
nvm install && nvm use
```

## Choices I made abd limitations

Start and approach: In the interest of time, I decided to add a skeleton of the app to get started quickly and achieve the brief without missing key components in the user journey.


## Testing approach

Given more time I would have added more Unit Tests, but I wanted to focus on the user journey and the key components of the app. Tests were not specified in the brief. Realistically I would have aimed for at least a 70% coverage. I feel adding test would have provided assurance and helped demonstrate intent and functionality to future editors.

## Css
I should use a CSS framework such as Tailwind. I wanted to get closer to the original designs.
